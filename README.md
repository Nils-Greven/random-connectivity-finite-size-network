Repository for Greven, Ranft, Schwalger, "How random connectivity shapes the fluctuating dynamics of finite-size neural populations", (https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16111)

The code provided will help recreate the data for the figures of the paper. In the following will be a short instruction which code needs to be run.
I might add more instructions sometime later.
I might clean up the code sometime later as for now it will contain all the code I have written for the project, regardless of whether it was used in the paper,
some of the code might be redundant. Variable names have changed during the project, some might not be consistent with the parameter names in the paper.

    parameters inside the file need to be adapted to the values of the figure
    - `micro_yn = true` for the quenched network
    - `micro_annealed_yn = true` for the annealed network
    - `meso_yn     = true` for MF2
    - `naive_yn    = true` for MF1
